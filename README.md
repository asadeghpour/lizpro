# MCP + Rancher Kubernetes Integration (lizpro)

This repository demonstrates a **working integration between MCP CLI and Rancher**
to manage Kubernetes environments using a **chat-driven interface** powered by **Ollama**.

The goal of this repo is to provide a **reference implementation** that shows:
- How to connect MCP CLI to a Rancher MCP server
- How Rancher APIs are exposed as MCP tools
- How to interact with Kubernetes using natural language
